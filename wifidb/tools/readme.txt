1		WiFiDB Daemon
--------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------

  The WiFiDB daemon is just a php script that I wrote that runs in the backgound
  and checks a fils_tmp table to see if there are any files wating to be imported.
  If there is a file or more then one, it will atempt to import them.

  There is a file called rund.php that starts/stops/and restarts the daemon. To use
  type 'php rund.php [start,stop,restart]'. This script will only run on linux 
  based systems. Windows is NOT supported. This is also an optional item it is not
  needed at all to run WiFiDB. To turn it on or off in the DB itself go to the 
  config.inc.php in the lib folder of where you have your WiFiDB installed, and 
  change the variable named sched to 0 (off) or 1 (on).

  To change settings for the daemon itself go to the daemon folder inside the tools 
  folder and open the config.inc.php file and change sleep to the number of seconds
  that you want to sleep before checking the files_tmp again, there is a safety so
  you cannot set it less then 5 min.


Usage: 
	rund.php {start|stop|restart|version(NIY)|help(NIY)}

		start			-	Start The WiFiDB Daemon.

		stop			-	Stop the WiFiDB Daemon.

		restart			-	Restart the WiFiDB Daemon.

		version (NIY)	-	The Version History that is below, just CLI.

		help (NIY)		-	This just on the CLI.

VERSION HISTORY
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------

~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Initial release, just scheduled imports.
==============================

~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Windows capable, I still wouldn't recommend it, but it works. Although it has a cmd window of its own, so to stay running it needs to stay open.
Better intergration with scheduling.php, added in Current AP, Importing? (Yes/No), Current AP/Total APs.
==============================

~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~
There was an issue with it sometimes not skipping a file if the hashes matched up.
Some spelling errors in messages.
For some reason the rund.php script sometimes would not properly execute the daemon 
	script, and result in rund.php saying the daemon has started, yet if you did 
	a ps -ax | grep "wifidbd", there would be no daemon running. Changing 
	popen($cmd, 'r') from 'r' to 'w' fixed this.

==============================

~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.3-1.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Was a very unstable time for the daemon,
documentation wasnt kept and the only truly known changes are 
the addition of colors for linux to the output, windows does not support color.
==============================

~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1 -> The daemon was being killed off by a stray die() in the failsafe section
	 for text based files that are no longer supported on import.
 ==============================
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.6.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1 -> Replaced the insert_file() and check_file() functions with their code, 
     was causing random errors with not inserting the file into its table 
	 after an import was finished.
2 -> Check_file was useing the file name to check to see if a file existed 
     in the files table, this was stupid because the file name may not be 
	 even close to the other file and have the same contents. Changed it 
	 so that it looks for the hash of the file.
==============================

~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~
1.7.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1 -> Fixed a bug where the daemon would have to wait till after a sleep
	 in order to find a file that was inserted into the files_tmp table
	 while it was in the middle of an import.
2 -> Added in Daemon Generated KML exports.
3 -> Daemon now checks if the log file is longer then 500 lines, if so
	 the file is moved to [tools_dir]/backups/logs/console_wifidbd_[date-time].log
4 -> Added a bash script writen by Andrew, was adpated from the 
	 plone startup bash script. Use either wifidbd or wifidbd.sh
==============================

--------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------
2			Convert Txt to VS1
--------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------

This is a converter for the Vistumbler Summery Text file to the VS1 file.

I wrote this script in windows, but it can run on any OS that you have PHP on.

There are two ways to run this, script based PHP or the packaged EXE. The EXE there is no need to have PHP installed, 
the script file, you will need PHP installed.

To run the exe just put the properly formated Txt file from Vistumbler in the TXT folder, double click the converter.exe file to run it. 
Or go to a command propmt and run it via that.


To run the script version all you need to do is download the PHP package from [http://us2.php.net/get/php-5.2.6-Win32.zip/from/a/mirror]

Browse to Y:\[Path to PHP]\bin\ 
               -  Where Y is the drive you have PHP installed in and [Path to PHP] is where PHP is stored on the drive.
Type "php X:\[Path to converter]\convert_vs1.php" 
               -  Where X is the drive you have the converter stored and [Path to converter] is the folder that the converter lives in.

The convert_vs1.php file searches the "text\" folder for vistumbler Text Summery files to convert.
It is self aware of where it is living so there is no need to configure it.


===================================================================

The convert_vs1() function:
This is the function that does all the work

$source : the dir and file that you are converting

"file"  : output the conversion to a VS1 file, [Supports "file", "File", or "FILE"] (I am working on having a database output too, via MySQL)



Example CLI output:
