Copyright (C) 2015 Andrew Calcutt, based on imp_expd.php by Phil Ferland.
This script is made to do imports and be run off of the importd.php daemon.
It is not possible to run this script on its own, it needs to be controled and scheduled by the importd.php daemon.
This is to prevent the import processes from colliding and thinking that an import is already in, when it is really not.
