Rewrite code to OO ( @= Not implemented yet, * = needs work still, ** = basically complete)
    dbcore()**
	daemon()**
	import()**
	export()*
	api()*
	security()*
	sql()**
	frontend()*
	graphing()@
	geocache()@
	languages()**
	mail()**
	xml()**

Re-design some of the pages [ap fetch, list all users, index, scheduling] *
Live Access Points wifidb_lived.php [management daemon] @

Maybe rewrite PostgreSQL (maybe Oracle and MSSQL if I have the will power) @
Maybe implement memcached @

Add exports to users page under the stats for user table and above the last import details for VS1, KML, KMZ, and CSV

Add sorting on All Users page for Username, ID, Number of Imports, Number of AP's.

Graphing page, the Graph type drop down does not stay on the line type if you generate that, it defaults to the bar graph, 
	same with the colors, they default back to red and black once generated.

I still have a lot of work to do...
